LOUD
====
A really simple microphone app / my first stab at android.

Volume can be adjusted using slider or physical buttons on phone.
Feedback is terrible if you try to run with phone's mic and speakers, 
but is okay if you connect to a bluetooth speaker. 
(Basically you just need the output to be not too audible from the input.)

Install from here: [apk] (./Loud/bin/Again.apk)
